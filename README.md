Final project for 590pz 2020 spring.

## Rotating Connect4

Our group is thinking about making an AI for the variantion version of Connect4. This AI should have the ability to choose the relatively perfect action at every step and also has the ability to learn from the game to get closer to always win the game. We also create one player vs player version with GUI to let people play with their friends.

### Rules
• The game needs two players to get involved.
• The game would be played as every player places a "coin" into the vertical board. 
• The "coin" will fall to the bottom of the board due to the gravity.
• The player who connect four of the "coin" first wins the game.

### Variation
• At every term, a player can choose rotate the board at any direction for 90 degree or place a "coin".
• After rotation, the "coins" will fall accordingly due to the gravity.

### Explanation
The following graph shows how the rule affects the game. At the first board, if the red player chooses not to place a red coin at the place where the yellow star stays for the original version of connect4, the player loses. However, at the current version of the game, the red player could choose to rotate the board clockwise for 90 degrees, which makes the red player win immediately.
